# Sorts-Programming-Project

This Java project is focused on implementing and practicing various sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort and Insertion Sort, for both integer arrays and string arrays. The program prompts the user to input values for these arrays and then demonstrates the sorting process step by step with clear print statements. It covers the following tasks:

Integer Arrays Sorting: Create two integer arrays and populate them with user input. Implement Selection Sort and Insertion Sort for these arrays, displaying each pass's progress as the algorithm repositions the integers.

String Arrays Sorting: Create two string arrays and populate them with user input in an unsorted order. Implement Selection Sort and Insertion Sort for the first array, sorting it in alphabetical order. Again, provide clear print statements to visualize the sorting process.

Descending Order Sorting: Repeat the above four sorting algorithms for both integer and string arrays but sort them in descending order. This gives you practice in reversing the sorting process.

ArrayList Sorting: Finally, replicate all eight sorting algorithms using ArrayLists instead of arrays. Display the sorting progress for both numerical and alphabetical orders.
